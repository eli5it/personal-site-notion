## Running the Project Locally

In order to utilize Notion as a CMS, you'll want to acquire an API key, and create a workspace with a database. Populate your own .env file with values for NOTION_API_KEY and
DATABASE_ID.

To run the project in development mode use the following.

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
