          Everything you see here I have designed and built myself. The website
          is using React and Chakra UI as a design system. The pages are
          generated by NextJS and are hosted on Vercel.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg text-dark-border my-7">
          The content for the website, such as articles, books and bookmarks are
          stored on Airtable and then pulled in through their API endpoint. If
          you are curious, you can explore the code for this website on my
          Github.
