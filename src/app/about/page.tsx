        <p>
          I'm an all-around curious person who can't get enough of exploring new
          ideas and asking lots of questions.
        </p>
        <p>
          In my free time, you can usually find me reading books, cooking,
          playing board games, outside with the bicycle or simply spending time
          with those closest to me.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm an advocate for working and learning in public, which I'm doing on
          and off on on LinkedIn, X, Bluesky and my YouTube channel.
